| 1 | The players encounter a group of more experienced adventurers heading in the other direction. If the players are polite, they are given some healing potions. |
| 2 | A naked gnome runs across the path, gasps at the party, then runs back. Cannot be pursued.                                                                    |

| 4  | A black dog runs across the path.                                                                                                                    |
| 5  | A lone yellow flower is growing in the middle of the path.                                                                                           |

| 11 | The players find an encampment of well armed, friendly humans. They may stay the night here and avoid a random encounter for the night.              |
| 12 | A dwarf falls out of the sky and splatters in front of the party. No logical source of the dwarf can be seen.                                        |

| 16 | A local ranger gives the party directions to their next destination, but he’s an ******* that sends them the wrong way. Increase the journey length. |
| 17 | An arrow strikes a nearby tree, with a note attached to it. The note reads “You are a fool for looking!” No source of the arrow can be found.        |

| 19 | A mystery key is found laying in the road. If used on a locked door, roll a D20. A 20 will unlock the door, after which the key is lost.             |
